"""Transport — thin ``zeep`` wrapper for the WSL SOAP services.

A :class:`WSLClient` instance caches one ``zeep.Client`` per ``service`` name
(e.g. ``CommitteeService``, ``LegislationService``) lazily on first call and
serializes responses to plain Python dicts so downstream normalizers don't
depend on zeep's typed-object model.

zeep itself is synchronous (uses ``requests`` under the hood), so the public
methods here are ``async`` and dispatch the blocking work via
``asyncio.to_thread``. Callers in async contexts (sidecar daemon, FastAPI
handlers, AdapterRunner) never block the event loop. Tests stub out the
network via vcrpy cassettes.
