# Commands

Full command reference for `usa-wa`. The everyday subset is in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#common-commands).

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (creates .venv, locks deps in uv.lock)
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hook (runs ruff on commit)
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Environment

Production secrets live in `/etc/usa-wa/.env`; dev/agent secrets in `./.env`. Both are git-ignored. The systemd unit loads them automatically; shell sessions must load manually:

```bash
export $(cat /etc/usa-wa/.env .env 2>/dev/null | xargs)
```

## Dev server

```bash
# Port 8001 — port 8000 belongs to systemd, never start uvicorn there manually
uv run uvicorn usa_wa_api.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

Reachable at `https://usa-wa.exe.xyz:8001/` via the exe.dev proxy.

## Tests

```bash
# Full suite — requires TEST_DATABASE_URL set to a non-prod database
uv run pytest

# Single file (skip the coverage gate, which measures all of packages/)
uv run pytest --no-cov packages/usa-wa-api/tests/test_health.py

# Integration-marked tests only (excluded by default)
uv run pytest -m integration
```

## Database migrations

Migrations require the **owner role** (DDL rights) — the DML-only `usa_wa_app`
that serves traffic cannot run them. In production, apply via the oneshot unit,
which runs `alembic upgrade head` + `scripts/grants.sql` under `DATABASE_URL_OWNER`:

```bash
sudo systemctl start usa-wa-migrate
```

Ad-hoc `alembic` commands work too, but only when `DATABASE_URL_OWNER` is in the
environment (the standard `export $(cat /etc/usa-wa/.env .env | xargs)` loads it;
`alembic/env.py` prefers it over `DATABASE_URL`):

```bash
# Apply pending migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Autogenerate a new revision from model diffs
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Show current head
uv run alembic current

# Show migration history
uv run alembic history
```

## Lint & format

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Systemd lifecycle

```bash
# After committing to main: restart to pick up changes
sudo systemctl restart usa-wa

# After editing deploy/usa-wa.service: reload then restart
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart usa-wa

# Tail live logs
sudo journalctl -u usa-wa -f
```

## Data refresh (manual / backfill)

Prod runs these on systemd timers; the forms below are the ad-hoc / backfill surface.
Pair with `USA_WA_BIENNIUM` to target a non-current biennium. See AGENTS.md § Common
Commands for the full option set.

```bash
# WSL committees + current-biennium meeting window (daily 06:00 UTC)
python -m usa_wa_adapter_legislature.refresh

# PDC — House member Position (1/2) seat Assignments (#69) + Senate person_wa_pdc
# cross-links (#75). Pulls GetSponsors once for both rosters, discovers the House winner
# cohort (start-1) and both staggered Senate cohorts (start-1, start-3). Daily 06:30 UTC,
# after the WSL refresh (binds onto its Persons). USA_WA_PDC_APP_TOKEN (optional) raises
# Socrata's rate limit.
python -m usa_wa_adapter_pdc.refresh
```

## Submodules

The `skills-vendor/` directory holds upstream skill repos as submodules. They are updated automatically by the `UserPromptSubmit` hook in [`.claude/settings.json`](../.claude/settings.json), but the manual commands are:

```bash
# Initialize submodules on a fresh clone
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Update vendored skills to the latest upstream main
git submodule update --remote --merge skills-vendor/gregoryfoster-skills skills-vendor/obra-superpowers
```
